It feels like I am trying to do a million things at once. What
started out as learn to make video games, has turned into.

- Learn Unity
- Learn C#/mono
- LEarn about game design/story telling
- Figure out how to deploy to google play
- Setup an online entity to publish my games under

I am using the following software/services to accomplish the above:

- Trello
    - This is where I am managing my work
- Github
    - Using github sites
    - Created a repo for issue management
- Google Communities
    - this is how I am managing my testers
- Unity
